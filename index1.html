            <p>The villainous Joker has tricked Super <span id="cname"></span> into drinking a super-UN-super potion that turns any super hero into a normal human being! Joker has hidden the antidote to this poisonous potion somewhere inside a maze house filled with dangerous monsters! You, dear reader, must help Super <span id="cname"></span> choose the right path to the antidote without being eaten alive and before Joker's potion steals <span id="cname"></span>'s super powers forever! Ready, let's begin...

              "You'll never find the antidote in time, Super <span id="cname"></span>, laughed the Joker hysterically while Super <span id="cname"></span> dashed towards the maze house. But once Super <span id="cname"></span> arrived the effects of the super-Un-super potion could already be felt. Super <span id="cname"></span> had two choices</p>

            <p>Stepping inside the maze house Super <span id="cname"></span> was immediately ambushed by two of Joker's henchmen! Weakened by the the super-Un-super potion, Super <span id="cname"></span> had to fight extra hard to overpower the evil doers. Once defeated, Super <span id="cname"></span> had three doors to choose from all marked with different names. Behind one of them was sure to be the antidote! But dangerous monsters could be lying in wait behind the others. Which door should Super <span id="cname"></span> choose?.</p>

          <p>Upon opening the door to the maze room, Super <span id="cname"></span> instantly felt dizzy. The room was a spinning kaleidoscope of colors that hypnotized Super <span id="cname"></span>, entrancing our superhero into a helpless, childlike state. Standing there, still as a statue in the spinning colors of the maze room, Super <span id="cname"></span> succumbed to the poison of the super-Un-super potion, losing all super powers. Better luck next time!</p>

          <p>"If I were the Joker," thought Super <span id="cname"></span>, "where would I hide the antidote? Hmmmmm, somewhere dark and scary, that's where!" Slowly, Super <span id="cname"></span> opened to door to the basement. Peaking inside the coast looked clear, no monsters, no henchmen. Stepping down the creaky stairs Super <span id="cname"></span> could see in the back of the basement a glowing beaker of golden liquid. "The antidote!" shouted Super <span id="cname"></span>, grabbing the glowing beaker and quickly chugging down it contents. Almost instantly Super <span id="cname"></span> could feel the effects. Super <span id="cname"></span> would remain super after all. Now, to go get that Joker!  </p>

          <p>"Surely the antidote will be hidden somewhere up high", thought Super <span id="cname"></span>. Ascending the stairs Super <span id="cname"></span> heard a deep and terrifying roar. Upon reaching the landing Super <span id="cname"></span> was face to face with the most ferocious fire breathing dragon anyone has ever seen! Our hero had to think fast before being roasted like a marshmallow! Quickly, Super <span id="cname"></span> ran behind the dragon to look for the antidote but no luck! Just then the giant dragon swung around tripping Super <span id="cname"></span> with its long scaly tail. Falling to the ground Super <span id="cname"></span> let out a scream as the giant dragon scorched our hero to cinders! Game over man. Better luck next time. </p>
